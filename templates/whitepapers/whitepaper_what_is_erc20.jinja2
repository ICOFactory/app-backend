        <h3>Ethereum (ETH) - The cryptocurrency</h3>
        <p>Ethereum is such a big deal now, you can find up to the minute quotes on mainstream financial websites, such as
        <a class="whitepaper_anchor" href="https://marketwatch.com">MarketWatch</a>, as well as more specialized outlets
        like <a class="whitepaper_anchor" href="https://coindesk.com">CoinDesk</a>. There are undoubtedly more people
        that can pontificate on the price trends of Ethereum than those that can tell you what it actually does.</p>

        <p>Unlike Bitcoin, which is only useful as a store of value, and only depleted by people losing track of their private keys, Ethereum is
        <em>consumed</em> by smart contracts being published and executed on the Ethereum blockchain. Currently, the vast majority of Ethereum being
        consumed is on a type of contract known as ERC20. This type of contract is what has fueled the ICO mania over the years. The benefit of "renting"
        Ethereum's blockchain for your own cryptocurrency is that, now especially, in the "crypto-winter", you benefit from an enormous network of miners
        who defend the integrity of your alt-coin in return for the chance to earn Ethereum which can be traded into Bitcoin or sold.
        </p>
        <h3>The Ethereum Blockchain</h3>
        <p>I find the easiest way to understand ERC20 is to think of the Ethereum blockchain as a public database
            offering free read access to the public and charging for write access. If you want to view all the publicly,
            available data on the Ethereum blockchain, <a class="whitepaper_anchor" href="https://etherscan.io">Etherscan.io</a>
            is an easy way to do this from your web browser.</p>
        <p>Any important database is at least distributed to some sort of backup, and Ethereum is no exception. One difference between Ethereum and
            traditional, centralized, databases is that the synchronization rate is extremely slow in comparison, whereas for an
            e-commerce database it might be desirable to sync between master and slave every transaction, with Ethereum
            the synchronization occurs in blocks of transactions. ERC20/Ethereum/blockchain <a class="whitepaper_anchor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing">OLTP</a> technology is not
            particularly useful for transactions where speed is most important. It is however, easy to find situations where
            the benefits of using a distributed, public database make up for this, such as keeping track of an item’s
            location in the supply chain. That said, with proper prioritization against others competing for use of the blockchain,
         Ethereum transactions may be performed quite quickly.</p>

        <h3>Benefits of using Ethereum for OLTP</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Public blockchain, practically impossible to lose data written</li>
            <li>Actual blockchain infrastructure supported by a functioning economy (you can buy Ethereum to write to the
                blockchain on Coinbase, specialized mining companies protect the integrity of the blockchain in return for
                mining fees in Ethereum, which they can cashout to pay their bills.
            </li>
            <li>May be cheaper in the long run than IBM Hyperledger or Ripple</li>
            <li>Incredible amount of open source infrastructure, for example, there are two compatible Ethereum node
                clients in widespread use, one written in C++ and the other written in Go. This allows a great deal of
                flexibility, resistance to catastrophic bugs in a single implementation.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Drawbacks of using Ethereum for OLTP</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ethereum, like all blockchain technologies, is somewhat slower than traditional relational database
                systems. Transactions are processed in a matter of minutes rather than fractions of a second.
            </li>
            <li>Long term cost is honestly unknowable due to the open market pricing system. That being said, you’d be a
                fool to assume you could predict the price of a less open system such as IBM Hyperledger or Ripple
            </li>
            <li>Cost is incurred in an unfamiliar manner compared to traditional OLTP</li>
            <li>Fluctuating cost, exchange risk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is ERC20 exactly?</h3>
        <p>For those that are familiar with relational, SQL database systems, it might be helpful to think of ERC20 as
            the interface to a database program. If you read the Ethereum white paper, Ethereum is described as a ‘blank
            canvas’, while that is technically true, the vast majority of traffic currently incurred on the Ethereum
            blockchain conforms to the ERC20 protocol. </p>
        <h3>ERC20 Functionality</h3>
        <p>ERC20 can be thought of as a program that manages ‘tokens’ between an unlimited number of addresses.
            ERC20Master will generate Solidity code for a basic ICO by inserting a few variables into a smart contract.
            When the smart contract is published to the blockchain, an initial number of tokens is generated, at that
            point, the owner of the contract (the ERC20Master Ethereum OLTP network) will be able to assign the tokens
            generated to any Ethereum address (basically, a random 160-bit Integer).</p>
        <h3>What does ERC20Master do?</h3>
        <p>ERC20Master helps quickly integrate ERC20 compatible online transaction processing (OLTP) on the public
            Ethereum blockchain to any application. One disadvantage to using a P2P distributed database is that bad
            actors (bad peers, “hackers”) can and will disrupt Ethereum nodes, whose addresses are necessarily public.
            For that reason, you cannot expect to process transactions in a reliable manner with a single Ethereum node.
            ERC20Master exposes a simple API at a single endpoint (a load balancer, which provides scalability and
            redundancy) to expedite integration into existing systems.</p>
        <h3>Specifically</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Generates ERC20 ‘smart contracts’ in Solidity</li>
            <li>Publishes smart contracts using a geographically distributed Ethereum OLTP network</li>
            <li>Executes ERC20 commands on published smart contract using its own network</li>
            <li>Handles provisioning, configuration and administration of Ethereum OLTP nodes</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a class="whitepaper_anchor" href="/create_user">Sign up for free</a> and generate your own smart contract. There are free tools to compile and deploy this smart
            contract in a matter of minutes.</p>
